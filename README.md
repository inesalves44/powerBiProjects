# Power BI Course -> Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence

## Overview

This repository is composed of the projects created in [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/).

It has 2 files and I will go over them.

### File nº1 -> Adventure works report

The idea of the course is to learn power BI by doing. It was a great way to learn how power bi works and how to construct a dashboard from raw data.

The project involved being a business analyst for a fictional company called Adventure Works.

This project has was separated in four parts:
1. treat the data in power query;
2. create relationship for the data in the data view;
3. create mesures and tables with dax mesures in report and table view;
4. finally create a report of multiple pages.

It was a fantastic way to better undersatnd powerBI and to do other power BI projects.

### File nº2 -> Maven Dashboard

The second file is a single page report for another fictional company. It was just to consilidate what I learned before.
